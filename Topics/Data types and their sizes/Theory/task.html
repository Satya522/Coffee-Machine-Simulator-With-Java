<h2>Data types and their sizes</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>This topic teaches the classification and properties of primitive types provided by Java. Maybe you already know some of them. There are several groups of basic types divided by meaning. Types from the same group operate similarly, but they have different sizes and, as a result, represent different ranges of values.</p><p>You do not need to know all this information by heart because it is easy to find it in the documentation or Google it. But a common understanding of these concepts is essential in job interviews and practice.</p><h5 id="numbers">Numbers</h5><p>Java provides several types for <strong>integers</strong> and <strong>fractional</strong> numbers. These types are often used in arithmetic expressions.</p><p><strong>Integer numbers</strong> (0, 1, 2, ...) are represented by the following four types: <code class="language-java">long</code>, ⁣<code class="language-java">int</code>, <code class="language-java">short</code>, and <code class="language-java">byte</code>(from the largest to the smallest). These types have different sizes and may represent different ranges of values. The range of an integer type is calculated as <span class="math-tex">\(−(2^{n−1})\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\((2^{n−1})−1\)</span>, where <em><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span></em> is the number of bits. The range includes 0, so we subtract 1 from the upper bound.</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-java">byte</code>: size 8 bits (1 byte), ranging from <span class="math-tex">\(-128\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(127\)</span>;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">short</code>: size 16 bits (2 bytes), ranging from <span class="math-tex">\(-32768\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(32767\)</span>;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">int</code>: size 32 bits (4 bytes), ranging from <span class="math-tex">\(−(2^{31})\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\((2^{31})−1\)</span>;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">long</code>: size 64 bits (8 bytes), ranging from <span class="math-tex">\(−(2^{63})\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\((2^{63})−1\)</span>.</p></li></ul><p>The sizes of types are always the same. They do not depend on the operating system or hardware and cannot be changed.</p><p>The most commonly used integer types are <code class="language-java">int</code> and <code class="language-java">long</code>. Try to use <code class="language-java">int</code> if it suits your purposes. Otherwise, use <code class="language-java">long</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-java">int one = 1;
long million = 1_000_000L;</code></pre><p><strong>Floating-point types</strong> represent numbers with fractional parts. Java has two such types: <code class="language-java">double</code> (64 bits) and <code class="language-java">float</code> (32 bits). These types can store only a limited number of significant decimal digits (~6-7 for <code class="language-java">float</code> and ~14-16 for <code class="language-java">double</code>). Usually, you will use the <code class="language-java">double</code> type in practice.</p><pre><code class="language-java">double pi = 3.1415;
float e = 2.71828f;</code></pre><p> </p><p>When you declare and initialize a <code class="language-java">float</code> variable, mark the assigned value with the special letter <code class="language-java">f</code>. Similarly, a <code class="language-java">long</code> value is marked with the letter <code class="language-java">L</code>.</p><p> </p><h5 id="characters">Characters</h5><p>Java has a type named <code class="language-java">char</code> to represent letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols. Each character is just a single letter enclosed in single quotes. This type has the same size as the <code class="language-java">short</code> type (2 bytes = 16 bits).</p><pre><code class="language-java">char lowerCaseLetter = 'a';
char upperCaseLetter = 'Q';
char dollar = '$';</code></pre><p>Characters represent symbols from many alphabets, including hieroglyphs and other special symbols.</p><h5 id="booleans">Booleans</h5><p>Java provides a type called <code class="language-java">boolean</code>, which can store only two values: <code class="language-java">true</code> and <code class="language-java">false</code>. It represents only one bit of information, but its size is not precisely defined.</p><pre><code class="language-java">boolean enabled = true;
boolean bugFound = false;</code></pre><p>You will often use this type in conditionals and as a result of comparing two numbers.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><ul><li><p>There are several types of integers and fractional numbers;</p></li><li><p>Integer numbers are represented by<strong> </strong><code class="language-java">long</code>, ⁣<code class="language-java">int</code>, ⁣<code class="language-java">short</code>, and <code class="language-java">byte</code>;</p></li><li><p>Floating-point types represent numbers with fractional parts: <code class="language-java">double</code> (64 bits) and <code class="language-java">float</code> (32 bits);</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">char</code> type represents letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">boolean</code> stores only <code class="language-java">true</code> and <code class="language-java">false </code>values.</p></li></ul><p>Remember that knowledge of sizes and ranges of data types may help you with interviews.</p>
